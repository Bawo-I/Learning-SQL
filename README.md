Learning SQL through hands on practice

So far, we have used SQL to add numbers together. We can also use SQL to subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.

Here are a few examples:

Subtraction: the query SELECT 1340 - 3; prints 1337.

Multiplication: we use the * symbol to signify multiplication. The query SELECT 7 * 3; prints 21

Division: we use the / symbol to signify division. The query SELECT 21 / 7; prints 3.

Here, we see a single query and renaming the results:

SELECT 1340 - 3 AS sub, 7 * 3 AS mult, 21 / 7 AS div, 5 * (2 + 3) AS sum_mult;
